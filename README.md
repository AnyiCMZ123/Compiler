# Compiler
Compiler (School project)

The following provided code is a basic compiler. A compiler is a
software tool that translates a program written in a source language
(like this code developed below) to a target language or to a code
executable on the target machine.
We are sure that this compiler, although it is basic, is complete by 6
phases that a compiler must have.

- 1st phase. “Lexical Analysis”
The lexical analyzer is responsible for dividing the source program into tokens, which are
Lexical units such as numbers, operators, variables, etc.
- 2nd phase. "Syntactic analysis"
It is the identification of the different components of a sentence. In the formation
Within a sentence, words are grouped together in larger and larger units.
Words are grouped into phrases, and the phrases are related to each other.
to create sentences.
- 3rd phase. “Semantic analysis”
Ensures that statements and program declarations are
semantically correct. It is a collection of procedures that the parser
called when required by the grammar.
- 4th phase. “Intermediate Code Generation”
It is the stage of the compiler in which a structured representation is produced and
abstract of the source program, capturing the semantics and logic of the
program before generating the final object code.
- 5th phase. “Code optimization”
This phase seeks to improve the efficiency and performance of the program by
application of techniques that reduce the execution time, the use of resources
or improve other aspects of the program. This phase is essential to obtain a
faster and more efficient final code.
- 6th phase. “Object code generation”
It is the stage of the compiler in which the source code or intermediate code is translated.
in machine instructions specific to the architecture of the target machine.
This phase ends the compilation process and produces the executable code that
it can be directly executed by the target system hardware.

### Previous requirements
- Have "(python 3.10)" installed on the computer to run.
- Mentalize mathematical operations that you want to try.
- Basic knowledge in Python to run the program.
- Basic knowledge of console use.

### Installation
You will need to have the Python “re” (requests) library installed.
You can use the Python pip install package as follows:

``` python -m pip install requests ```
